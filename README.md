# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a fun playing game to pass your time and a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend canâ€™t agree on something.

# Version 1
A 2 player game and the one reaches 5 points first will be the winner. In this version, one player is you (A real user) and other player is computer. You can see the results in console tab in the developer tools. OR press F12 to instantly open console pane.
Till now it is a console based game and we are working on its GUI and sooner it will be available on the web.
